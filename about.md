<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>For too long have white male astronomers shuffled through academic hallways in silence. </p>

Hi there. Recent events have compelled me to create this blog. There are number of on-going systeming isssues in astronomy which need to be discussed but an important voice, the majority, is keeping silent. The mentality of ``you're either with us (the minority), or with the terrorists (racists/sexists/mysognists)''. This is a safe space for white male astronomers to gather to read about the pressing issues of our industry. If you're a white male, great, what you'll see on this site might hit a little close to home. If you're not a white male, then what you read on this site will likely be in the minds of your white male colleagues at your institute, but they're too afraid to say it for fear of jeapodizing their careers. 

Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous because most of these opionions will likely to cause me to lose any future hope of a tenure in astronomy. Such is the way of the world.
